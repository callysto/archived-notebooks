    "## Introduction\n",
    "Over the past 4.6 billion years, the Earth has been constantly changing. As we know, the earth is always spinning and plate tectonics results in the the movement and formation of different continents. These changes occur over millions of years and can be observed from the surface by observing land forms and types of rocks in  the area. There are many specific indications that showcase different changes. These indications can be separated into two categories, sudden change and gradual change.\n",
    "### Sudden Change\n",
    "After a change occurs in the subsurface, it is brought to the surface as an event that is commonly classified as a \"natural disaster\" such as earthquakes and volcanoes. The main cause of these events is plate tectonics. Earth's crust is divided into many pieces called plates which move in relation to one another. Typically, plates move at a rate of 10cm/yr which seems very slow. As the plates move, they exert pressure on one another can result in earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.\n"

    "A Seismograph is an instrument that is used to record fluctuations in the ground shown in figure 4. This is commonly used to predict and record earthquakes. There are 3 types of earthquake waves: p waves, s waves and surface waves which occur in that order respectively. All of these can be seen on seismograph records as seen in Figure 5 below. An earthquake begins at a set point called the Focal point which the source of wave propagation. P waves are also referred to as primary waves and are recorded first as they move the fastest and it is transmitted through the whole Earth. S waves are also referred to as secondary waves and are the second wave to be recorded. These waves can not travel through liquids such as the mantle. This can be seen in Figure 5. A surface wave is the mechanical wave that causes the most damage during the Earthquake.\n",
